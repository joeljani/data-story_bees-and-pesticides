# Data Story - Bees and pesticides
“If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would only have four years of life left.” ― Albert Einstein

This is a pretty vague statement. But it has some truth to it. Bees are very important for the ecosystem and are greatly understimated. These tiny cute creatures pollinate a third of everything we eat. Without them we would have a hard time in maintaining most of the fruits and vegetables we eat on a daily basis.

And the problem is, that the bees are dying at an alarming rate.

This data story examines if there is a correlation between the bee colony losses and the use of selected Neonicotinoid Pesticides, as Neonicotinoid are the most harmful pesticides for the bees.
